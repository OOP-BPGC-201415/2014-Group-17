UMLFinal :

Class Diagram: Each class corresponds to a user interacting with the application. All these users need to sign in to perform the corresponding resposiblities assigned to them. Hence they implement the login interface. The class dependancies and relationships have been depicted. Hostel representatives are essentially members of some hostel. Hence a generalization is depicted. Similarly, the other real world scenarios have been modelled and depicted.

Sequence Diagram: The order in which the application is used,which in turn depicts the order in which the functions are called have been described.

Collaboration diagram: Each class functions independantly relying only on it's own functions. Hence the collaberation diagram only has self loops. However all the classes implement the interface login which defines the login function and the check rules function. Hence, ALL classes collaberate with login interface.

Activity diagram: The sequence of activities taking place in the working of the application beginiing at the login stage and commencing at the logout stage have been depicted. ONe the login activity is completed the actvities are branched out according to the resposibility of the user. Subsequent activities are then depicted.
