a) Positives of our group:
All members of our group were extremely friendly with each other. We were cooperative to each other and helped others learn.

b)Negatives of the group:
We didnt take things seriously till the last minute,till we were pressed for time. We weren't very organized when it came to planing and dcision making.

c) What would you do differently next time?
None of us knew anything about web applications. We had to learn the entire thing from scratch ,before it was introduced in class,a few days before submission.
This caused a lot of glitches in the project and debugging it was a hard time.
We wouldn't try a competely new concept till we are completely sure about pulling it off.
